# NGSeminaR  

To follow the seminar, you will need to have access to Rstudio and R.  
I recommend you to use the Rstudio on the cloud, available at: https://rstudio.cloud/plans/free  . Please make an account and log in. 

If you prefer, you can install [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) locally to your computer! (The download and instalation takes a few minutes and during this time your connection might be unstable so you might have problems following if you are following the live session. )


Once you log in to Rstudio cloud go to your workspace and open:
New Proect -> New project from Git Repo.
copy the path to this repository.
